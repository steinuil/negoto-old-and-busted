# shukochan
A shitty imageboard which probably won't have many features and that nobody will run.

Written in Ruby using Sinatra, MongoDB, eRuby and a few other smaller Ruby gems that aren't really worth mentioning.

**Warning**: This is the first web application I ever wrote, so it will probably be horrible and full of shitty code. Also, it's nowhere near done yet, I'm just uploading it to github to make it easy to transfer.

Don't actually use this yet.

## TODO
* Render the thread pages.
* Images.
  * It'd be nice to use [libvips](https://github.com/jcupitt/ruby-vips) for that.
* Actual support for multiple boards.
* Control panel for the mods or whatever.
* Live updating and sorceries of the sort which will require ECMAscript.
  * The Language That Shall Not Be Named sucks ass, so it'd be nice to use one of those cool & hip languages that compile to it. Hell, [there's a fuckload of them](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS), there has to be one that somehow sucks less.
* Make it so that it won't crash and burn if you don't do everything right.
  * This phase probably has a cooler name that will make you feel smarter when you say it.
* Make the whole thing not look so half-assed.

# Negoto
An imageboard written Ruby using Sinatra and a few other things.

# Requirements
* Ruby (tested in Ruby 2.3.0)
* A database compatible with [Sequel](http://sequel.jeremyevans.net) (tested with SQLite)
* Image/GraphicsMagick

# Running
* Install the required gems with `bundle install`
* Create `config.yml` and configure it to your liking
* Put some banners into `public/banners` if you so desire
* Run `start.rb`
* Run `app.rb`

# Administering
* Run `admin.rb`

# Resetting
* Run `start.rb reset`

# Features
This is just a list of ideas that I might want to implement later. Not all of them might make it.
